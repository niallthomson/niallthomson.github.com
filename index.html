					<p class="margin-b-50">Technology is something I've been interested in as long as I remember, and there was never any question what I would
						choose to do for a living. I've always been interested in learning everything and anything I can in order to build things that work, and 
						thats propagated through to my career, where I've never dwelled in one area for long. Now I spend my time working on anything from 
						application architecture, cloud infrastructure strategy and automation, and Devops processes and culture.
					</p>
					<p class="margin-b-50">I was fortunate to be offered the opportunity to move my life from Scotland to the USA in 2012. I've grabbed 
						that chance and never looked back. In the time since I've spent several years on both coasts and visited everywhere I can in between.
					</p>
					<p class="margin-b-50">In my spare time I like to do some hiking, indoor rock climbing and drinking all the beer I can get my hands on. During 
						the winter I like to do a bad impression of someone who knows how to snowboard.
